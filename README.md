# AA_Scala_Reception

### Concept
This project involved the design of a customized staircase in an existing lobby of a hotel.Being placed in the centre of the lobby, the project complexity lied in designing an appealing form that fits within the surrounding while solving the structural constraints defined by the available slab area on the upper floor that can be demolished for the stairs to reach the upper floor. The upper floor represents an "outdoor" sitting area and bar, which is also newly designed to allow for more outdoor, aerated environment for the customers. 



### Tools Used
The stairs were developed in GH/Rhino and integrated in Revit in the design of the newly renovated lobby and outdoor seating area on the upper floor. The first attempts was to try use ready-made definitons like the one by Forst Hell. However, the complex shape (developed by a spiral curve) couldnt be achieved. Accordingly, the desingn was developed from scratch by GH nodes but still putting in consideration the workflow of Forst Hell.
